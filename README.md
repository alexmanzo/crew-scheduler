<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In my current full-time work, I manage a student group of 30-40 students to staff up to 100 live productions of sporting events throughought the year. Managing availability and scheduling for several events with an array of needs, I wanted to develop an web application that would make this process easier.

Crew Scheduler allows me to create all events for the year, and then have students log in to update their availability. When availability is in, I can go through an assign crew to events, and go back and edit as needed.
